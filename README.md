1. first prints 1 with no waiting, then the print of 2 is waiting for timeout so no printing, print of 3 is waiting for promised resolve(even though there's no await it will still wait), printing 4 with no waiting, printing 3 cause there was nothing really to wait for and then after the timeout 2 is printed
2. 2 and 4 not really waiting for anything, even though the timeout is for 0 seconds the promise is prior to timeout so the order of prints is 2,4,1,3
3. first prints in sync 4, then calls demo and print in sync 1, then it hits the dirst await so it pauses the demo function with a promise to come back(very dramatically), prints the 5 and actually comes back to demo after finished all tasks, prints 2, hits another await promise(with nothing to wait cause all tasks are done, and eventually prints 3.
4. first calls level1 function and prints 6, then calls level2 function and prints 4 and then calls levl3 function and prints 1. all the functions are async and the callings are await, so once it will hit the await promise and get it resolved it will run. however, the lambda inside the await promise is happenig first and printing 2, then level 3 is waiting for script to end after the await, level 2 now gets the resolved promise and is also waiting for the script to end, same for level 3. once the script ends it wakes up by the queue, so level 3 now printing 3 and finishing, then level 2 prints 5 and finishing and then level 1 prints 7.
5. level1 is called and prints 6, calls level 2 this yime with no await. level 2 prints 4 and class level 3 with await. level 3 prints 1, hitting the await with the promise, again does the lambda first so it prints 2, then sending the resolved and waiting the script to end, level 2 sees the resolved and now also waiting for end of script, but level 1 is not waiting now so prints the 7, now script is ended so print 3 first in queue and happens first, then  5 can be printed
